This has been ripped directly from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/editor/word-wrap/autoload.el][Doom Emacs]] +word-wrap-mode and put into a package that can be used with vanilla emacs.

Please also ensure that you install
If this minor mode is updated inside of doom emacs then I will also update this

** Insallation Instructions
*** Straight (preffered way)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package adaptive-wrap)
  (use-package adaptive-word-wrap-mode
   :straight (adaptive-word-wrap-mode :type git :host github :repo "samwdp/adaptive-word-wrap-mode")
   :hook (after-init . global-adaptive-word-wrap-mode)) 
#+end_src

*** Other methods
If you use any other version control installable package manager, Elpaca, build in vc-package etc, please modify the Straight installation. There are guides on how to change these over.
If you have a working example, raise an issue and I will update the readme with the insallation instructions.
